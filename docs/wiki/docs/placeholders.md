# PlaceholderAPI Integration

BlockBall provides extensive placeholder support for dynamic content in scoreboards, chat messages, signs, and other plugins. This guide covers all available placeholders and how to use them effectively.

## üîß Setup Requirements

BlockBall integrates seamlessly with **PlaceholderAPI** (PAPI), one of the most popular Bukkit plugins for dynamic text replacement.

### Installation
1. Install [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) on your server
2. Install BlockBall (placeholders work automatically)
3. Use placeholders in any PAPI-compatible plugin

### Basic Usage
In any PAPI-compatible context, use BlockBall placeholders like this:
```
%blockball_game_redScore%
%blockball_player_name%
%blockball_game_displayName%
```

---

## üéØ Multi-Arena Support

!!! important "Arena-Specific Placeholders"
    Since BlockBall supports multiple arenas per server, external plugins need to specify which arena's data to display.

### External Plugin Format
When using placeholders in external plugins (like scoreboards, chat plugins, etc.), append the arena name:

```
%blockball_game_displayName_<arena_name>%
%blockball_game_redScore_stadium1%
%blockball_game_blueScore_mygame%
```

### Internal BlockBall Usage
Within BlockBall configurations (arena files, signs, etc.), use the base format:
```
%blockball_game_displayName%
%blockball_game_redScore%
```

```bash
/blockball placeholder %blockball_game_redScore%
/blockball placeholder %blockball_player_name%
```

This helps verify that placeholders are working correctly and returning expected values.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Placeholder shows as text | Install PlaceholderAPI |
| Empty/null values | Check arena name suffix for external plugins |
| Outdated information | Use `/blockball reload` to refresh |
| Statistics not working | Requires Patreon version |

### Best Practices

!!! tip "Performance"
    - Avoid excessive placeholder usage in high-frequency updates
    - Cache placeholder values when possible
    - Use specific placeholders rather than checking everything

!!! info "Formatting"
    - Placeholders return raw values - apply formatting in your display system
    - Color codes work in `displayName` placeholders
    - Numeric values can be formatted using your scoreboard/chat plugin

This comprehensive placeholder system allows you to create rich, dynamic displays that enhance the BlockBall experience for your players!
