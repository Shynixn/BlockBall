# Advanced Customization

Take your BlockBall arenas to the next level with extensive customization options. This guide covers everything from basic tweaks to advanced configurations using AI assistance.

## üéØ Overview

BlockBall offers hundreds of configuration options through arena YAML files. These files control everything from game mechanics to visual effects, allowing you to create unique gameplay experiences.

---

## üìÅ Configuration Files

### Location
All arena customizations are stored in YAML files located at:
```
/plugins/BlockBall/arena/<arena_name>.yml
```

For example, if your arena is named `game1`, the file will be:
```
/plugins/BlockBall/arena/game1.yml
```

### Editing Workflow
1. **Stop the arena**: `/blockball toggle <arena_name>` (if enabled)
2. **Edit the YAML file** using your preferred text editor
3. **Apply changes**: `/blockball reload <arena_name>`
4. **Test your changes** in-game

!!! tip "Text Editor Recommendations"
    - **Notepad++** (Windows) - Free with YAML syntax highlighting
    - **Visual Studio Code** - Cross-platform with excellent YAML support
    - **Sublime Text** - Lightweight with good plugin support

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Game Mechanics

### Ball Physics Deep Dive

Understanding ball physics is crucial for creating the right gameplay feel:

```yaml
ball:
  # Gravity and movement
  gravityModifier: 0.07        # Higher = ball falls faster
  airResistance: 0.001         # Higher = ball slows down more in air
  rollingResistance: 0.1       # Higher = ball stops rolling sooner
  
  # Player interaction strengths
  horizontalTouchModifier: 1.0  # Running into ball power
  verticalTouchModifier: 1.0    # Jump-touch ball power
  shotVelocity: 1.5            # Left-click power shot
  shotPassYVelocityOverwrite: 1.0  # Override vertical shot modifier
  passVelocity: 1.2            # Right-click gentle pass
  
  # Ball rotation and limits
  maximumSpinVelocity: 0.08    # How much the ball can spin
  maximumPitch: 60             # Highest angle ball can fly
  minimumPitch: 0              # Lowest angle (ground level)
  defaultPitch: 20             # Standard launch angle
```

    horizontalStrength: 2.0    # Forward momentum multiplier
    soundEffect:
      name: ENTITY_WIND_CHARGE_WIND_BURST,ENTITY_GHAST_SHOOT,GHAST_FIREBALL

## üèÜ Team Equipment and Visual Identity

### Leather Armor Color System

BlockBall uses leather armor with custom colors for team identification:

```yaml
# Team Red armor configuration
redTeamMeta:
  armor:
    - |
      item:
        ==: org.bukkit.inventory.ItemStack
        v: 4554
        type: LEATHER_BOOTS
        meta:
          ==: ItemMeta
          meta-type: COLORABLE_ARMOR
          color:
            ==: Color
            ALPHA: 255
            RED: 255    # Full red
            GREEN: 0    # No green
            BLUE: 0     # No blue
```

### Color Examples for Teams

```yaml
# Classic team colors
# Red Team: RGB(255, 0, 0)
# Blue Team: RGB(0, 0, 255)
# Green Team: RGB(0, 255, 0)
# Yellow Team: RGB(255, 255, 0)
# Purple Team: RGB(128, 0, 128)
# Orange Team: RGB(255, 165, 0)
# Pink Team: RGB(255, 192, 203)
# Cyan Team: RGB(0, 255, 255)
```

### Custom Ball Appearance

```yaml
ball:
  render:
    # Custom ball item (soccer ball head texture)
    item:
      typeName: PLAYER_HEAD,397
      amount: '1'
      durability: '3'
      # Base64 encoded soccer ball skin
      skinBase64: eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vdGV4dHVyZXMubWluZWNyYWZ0Lm5ldC90ZXh0dXJlLzhlNGE3MGI3YmJjZDdhOGMzMjJkNTIyNTIwNDkxYTI3ZWE2YjgzZDYwZWNmOTYxZDJiNGVmYmJmOWY2MDVkIn19fQ==
      
    # Ball positioning and rotation
    rotating: true           # Ball spins as it moves
    offSetY: -1.0           # Visual height adjustment
```

### Understanding Command Types

BlockBall supports three types of command execution:

- **SERVER**: Execute as console (admin privileges)
- **SERVER_PER_PLAYER**: Execute as console for each player individually  
- **PER_PLAYER**: Execute as the player themselves

### Essential Command Integration

```yaml
# Automatic scoreboard and bossbar setup
joinCommands:
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /blockballscoreboard add blockball_scoreboard %blockball_player_name%
    cooldown: 0
    delay: 0
    playerPermission: ''  # Optional permission requirement
    
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /blockballbossbar add blockball_bossbar %blockball_player_name%
    cooldown: 0
    delay: 0

# Cleanup when players leave
leaveCommands:
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /blockballscoreboard remove blockball_scoreboard %blockball_player_name%
    
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /blockballbossbar remove blockball_bossbar %blockball_player_name%
```

### Event-Based Commands

```yaml
# Goal celebration commands
goalCommands:
  - type: SERVER
    command: /tellraw @a ["",{"text":"GOAL! ","color":"gold","bold":true},{"text":"%blockball_player_name%","color":"yellow"},{"text":" scores for ","color":"white"},{"text":"%blockball_team_displayName%","color":"aqua"}]
    delay: 10  # Wait 0.5 seconds after goal
    
# Game start announcements  
gameStartCommands:
  - type: SERVER
    command: /title @a title {"text":"MATCH START!","color":"green","bold":true}
    
  - type: SERVER  
    command: /playsound minecraft:entity.ender_dragon.growl master @a ~ ~ ~ 1 1.2
    delay: 20

# Win/lose rewards
winCommands:
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /give %blockball_player_name% diamond 1
    
  - type: PER_PLAYER
    command: /msg %blockball_player_name% Congratulations on your victory!

# Tournament integration
backTeleportCommands:  # After each goal
  - type: SERVER
    command: /tournament match update %blockball_game_name%
```

### Available Placeholders

Use these placeholders in commands to access game data:

- `%blockball_player_name%` - Player's username
- `%blockball_team_displayName%` - Team's display name  
- `%blockball_game_name%` - Arena name
- `%blockball_game_displayName%` - Arena display name
- `%blockball_team_score%` - Current team score
- `%blockball_enemy_score%` - Opposing team score

### Economy Integration Example

```yaml
# Reward system with economy plugin
goalCommands:
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /eco give %blockball_player_name% 100
    
winCommands:
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER  
    command: /eco give %blockball_player_name% 500
    
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /give %blockball_player_name% gold_ingot 3
    playerPermission: "myplayers.vip" # If this is set, only players with this permission receive the gold ingots.

looseCommands:
  - type: SERVER_PER_PLAYER
    command: /eco give %blockball_player_name% 50  # Participation reward
```

## üîÑ Testing and Iteration

### Testing Workflow
1. **Make small changes** - Test one feature at a time
2. **Use test server** - Avoid disrupting live gameplay  
3. **Get player feedback** - Real users provide valuable insights
4. **Document changes** - Keep notes on what works well

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Arena won't load | YAML syntax errors | Use online YAML validator, check indentation |
| Ball doesn't spawn | ballSpawnPoint coordinates wrong | Verify coordinates are within corner1/corner2 bounds |
| Teams can't score | Goal coordinates incorrect | Check goal corner1/corner2 define valid goal areas |
| Players stuck in walls | Spawn points inside blocks | Move spawnpoint coordinates to open areas |
| Commands not executing | Wrong command type or syntax | Use SERVER_PER_PLAYER for most integrations |
| Sounds not playing | Outdated sound names | Use comma-separated names for version compatibility |
| Double jump not working | Cooldown too high or disabled | Check enabled: true and reduce cooldown value |
| Ball physics feel wrong | Velocity/gravity settings off | Start with default values and adjust gradually |
| Scoreboard errors | Missing BlockBall scoreboard plugin | Install companion plugins or remove scoreboard commands |
| Armor not colored | Incorrect RGB values | Use values 0-255 for RED, GREEN, BLUE components |

### YAML Syntax Reminders

!!! warning "Common YAML Mistakes"
    - **Indentation**: Use spaces, not tabs. Each level = 2 spaces
    - **Colons**: Always add space after colons: `key: value`
    - **Quotes**: Use quotes around text with special characters
    - **Lists**: Start list items with `- ` (dash + space)
    - **Null values**: Use `null` for empty values, not blank

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Correct YAML formatting
meta:
  customizingMeta:
    damageEnabled: false
    backTeleport: true
  lobbyMeta:
    maxScore: 10
    
# ‚ùå Incorrect formatting (will cause errors)
meta:
customizingMeta:
damageEnabled:false  # Missing space after colon
backTeleport: true
lobbyMeta:
    maxScore:10      # Missing space after colon
```
