# Advanced Customization

Take your BlockBall arenas to the next level with extensive customization options. This guide covers everything from basic tweaks to advanced configurations using AI assistance.

## üéØ Overview

BlockBall offers hundreds of configuration options through arena YAML files. These files control everything from game mechanics to visual effects, allowing you to create unique gameplay experiences.

---

## üìÅ Configuration Files

### Location
All arena customizations are stored in YAML files located at:
```
/plugins/BlockBall/arena/<arena_name>.yml
```

For example, if your arena is named `game1`, the file will be:
```
/plugins/BlockBall/arena/game1.yml
```

### Editing Workflow
1. **Stop the arena**: `/blockball toggle <arena_name>` (if enabled)
2. **Edit the YAML file** using your preferred text editor
3. **Apply changes**: `/blockball reload <arena_name>`
4. **Test your changes** in-game

!!! tip "Text Editor Recommendations"
    - **Notepad++** (Windows) - Free with YAML syntax highlighting
    - **Visual Studio Code** - Cross-platform with excellent YAML support
    - **Sublime Text** - Lightweight with good plugin support
