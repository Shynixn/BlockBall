## üèóÔ∏è Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Before setting up referee mode, ensure you have:
1. **Patreon subscription** for BlockBall
2. **Working minigame arena** (complete the [basic setup](game.md) first)
3. **Proper permissions** configured for referees

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Create a Standard Minigame Arena

    You **must** start with a working minigame arena before converting to referee mode. Follow the [game creation guide](game.md) completely first.

Ensure your arena has all required elements:
- ‚úÖ Playing field defined
- ‚úÖ Both team goals set
- ‚úÖ Ball spawn point configured
- ‚úÖ Team spawn points established
- ‚úÖ Lobby spawn points configured
- ‚úÖ Arena enabled and tested

#### Step 2: Set Referee Positions

**Field Referee Position**
Position yourself where the referee should spawn during active gameplay:
```bash
/blockball location game1 referee_spawnpoint
```

**Lobby Referee Position**  
Move to where the referee should wait during lobby phase:
```bash
/blockball location game1 referee_lobby
```

!!! tip "Positioning Tips"
    - **Field position**: Center of field or sideline for best visibility
    - **Lobby position**: Elevated platform or special area separate from players

#### Step 3: Convert to Referee Game

Transform your minigame into a referee-controlled match:
```bash
/blockball gamerule gameType game1 refereegame
```

#### Step 4: Enable and Test

Activate your referee arena:
```bash
/blockball toggle game1
```

Verify the conversion worked:
```bash
/blockball list
```

**Expected Output:**
```
game1 [My first game] [enabled] [refereegame]

### Starting a Match

#### Player Join Process
Players join normally using existing methods:
```bash
/blockball join game1 red

    The lobby countdown will **NOT** start until a referee joins the game.

#### Referee Join
A qualified admin joins as referee:
```bash
/blockball join game1 referee
```

**Required Permission**: `blockball.referee.join`

```yaml
# Add to scoreboard lines
lines:
  - "Cards: %blockball_player_cardDisplay%"
  # Or show individual counts
  - "%blockball_player_redCards% Red, %blockball_player_yellowCards% Yellow"
```

**Visual Examples:**
- `üü®üü®üü•` - Two yellow cards, one red card
- `2 Red, 1 Yellow` - Numerical display
