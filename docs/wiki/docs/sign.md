## üèóÔ∏è Creating Signs

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Place a Sign
Place any type of sign block in your world where you want players to interact.

#### Step 2: Choose Sign Type
Execute the appropriate command for your desired sign functionality:

```bash
# General join sign (auto-assigns team)
/blockballsign add blockball_join_sign arena <game_name>

# Leave game sign
/blockballsign add blockball_leave_sign arena <game_name>

# Team-specific join signs
/blockballsign add blockball_join_red_sign arena <game_name>
/blockballsign add blockball_join_blue_sign arena <game_name>
```

#### Step 3: Apply to Sign
Right-click the sign you placed. The sign will automatically update with BlockBall formatting and functionality.

### Practical Examples

```bash
# Example: Create join sign for "stadium1" arena
/blockballsign add blockball_join_sign arena stadium1

# Example: Create red team sign for tournament arena
/blockballsign add blockball_join_red_sign arena tournament_final

# Example: Create leave sign (works for any game)
/blockballsign add blockball_leave_sign arena stadium1
```

## üé® Sign Customization

### Configuration Files

BlockBall uses an internal version of [ShyCommandSigns](https://shynixn.github.io/ShyCommandSigns/wiki/site/installation/) for sign functionality. You can customize appearance and behavior through configuration files.

**Configuration Location**: `/plugins/BlockBall/sign/`

### Basic Customization

#### Edit Sign Text
Modify the sign templates in the configuration folder:

```yaml
# Example: /plugins/BlockBall/sign/blockball_join_sign.yml
template:
  line1: "&6[BlockBall]"
  line2: "%arena_displayName%"
  line3: "&7Click to Join!"
  line4: "&a%arena_players%/%arena_maxPlayers%"
```

#### Apply Changes
After editing configuration files:
```bash
/blockballsign reload
# OR
/blockball reload
```

### Advanced Customization Options

#### Dynamic Sign Content
```yaml
# Show different text based on game state
template:
  line1: "&6[BlockBall]"
  line2: "%arena_displayName%"
  line3: "%arena_state_display%"
  line4: "&7%arena_players%/%arena_maxPlayers%"

# Custom state messages
states:
  JOINABLE: "&aClick to Join!"
  RUNNING: "&eGame in Progress"
  DISABLED: "&cArena Closed"
```

#### Team-Specific Styling
```yaml
# Red team sign customization
red_team_template:
  line1: "&c&l[RED TEAM]"
  line2: "%arena_displayName%"
  line3: "&7Join the Fire!"
  line4: "&c%red_players%/%red_maxPlayers% players"
  
# Blue team sign customization  
blue_team_template:
  line1: "&9&l[BLUE TEAM]"
  line2: "%arena_displayName%"
  line3: "&7Join the Water!"
  line4: "&9%blue_players%/%blue_maxPlayers% players"
```

#### Interactive Effects
```yaml
# Add particle effects and sounds
effects:
  click_sound: "entity.experience_orb.pickup"
  success_sound: "entity.player.levelup"
  failure_sound: "entity.villager.no"
  
particles:
  success: "VILLAGER_HAPPY"
  failure: "VILLAGER_ANGRY"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Sign doesn't work | Command not executed properly | Re-run the sign command and right-click again |
| Wrong text displaying | Configuration not reloaded | Use `/blockballsign reload` |
| Players can't click | Missing permissions | Check player has `blockball.command` |
| Sign breaks functionality | Incorrect arena name | Verify arena exists with `/blockball list` |

### Testing Signs

#### Verify Sign Functionality
1. **Check arena exists**: `/blockball list`
2. **Test with admin**: Right-click as administrator
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure players have required permissions
4. **Monitor console**: Look for error messages

#### Debug Information
```bash
# Test arena accessibility
/blockball join <arena_name>

# Check player permissions
/lp user <player> permission check blockball.command

# Verify sign configuration
