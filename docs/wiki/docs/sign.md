## üèóÔ∏è Creating Signs

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Place a Sign
Place any type of sign block in your world where you want players to interact.

#### Step 2: Choose Sign Type
Execute the appropriate command for your desired sign functionality:

```bash
# General join sign (auto-assigns team)
/blockballsign add blockball_join_sign arena <game_name>

# Leave game sign
/blockballsign add blockball_leave_sign arena <game_name>

# Team-specific join signs
/blockballsign add blockball_join_red_sign arena <game_name>
/blockballsign add blockball_join_blue_sign arena <game_name>
```

#### Step 3: Apply to Sign
Right-click the sign you placed. The sign will automatically update with BlockBall formatting and functionality.

/blockballsign add blockball_join_sign arena stadium1

# Example: Create red team sign for tournament arena
