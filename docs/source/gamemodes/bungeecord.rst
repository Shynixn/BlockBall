Bungeecord Minigame
===================

The Game Mode Bungeecord Minigame is a advanced game mode to give BlockBall the rights to manage it's on game server.

This guide will not explain how BungeeCord works so do not continue if you are not familiar with it.

Make sure you created a base game first before you continue.

Please take a look at associated words which will be used in this guide:

* Gameserver: Server where the BlockBall arena is located and BlockBall is managing it.
* Hubserver: Any other server where players can join the Gameserver by clicking a Blockball sign.

2. Create a Base Game on this server.
3. Go to the **Settings Page** of your arena and select the GameType Bungee.

3. Set the lobby spawnpoint and the leave spawnpoint.
4. Customize the other available options to your own needs.

You can find all options explained at the bottom of this page.



Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

* Max Score: Max amount of goals the players can score before the arena resets itself back to zero.
* Leave Spawnpoint: Spawnpoint for players who leave the game. If you leave it empty you will not be able to set up signs for leaving later in the customizing section.
* Even teams enabled: Should the team choice of the player be ignored if too many players are on one team?
* Max Duration: Max amount of time in seconds how a match can last.
* Lobby Spawnpoint: Position where players spawn when they join the game.


Winning condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also, you should take notice of the fact that you can now choose the winning condition for games.

* Setting the Max Score low (5) and the Max Duration high (500) causes the first team to reach 5 goals in 500 seconds to win.
* Setting the Max Score high (100) and the Max Duration low (200) causes the team with the most goals in 200 seconds to win the match.
